# Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models as Prompt Optimizers: An Analogical Analysis with Gradient-based Model Optimizers

This repo provides the source code & data of our paper: Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models as Prompt Optimizers: An Analogical Analysis with Gradient-based Model Optimizers.



## 😀 Overview

**Highlights**:

- 1️⃣ We are the first to conduct a systematic study for LLM-based prompt optimizers.
- 💡 By drawing inspiration from gradient-based model optimization techniques, we develop a capable **G**radient-inspired LLM based **P**rompt **O**ptimizer called **GPO**.
- 🔝 GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.

We propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable **G**radient-inspired LLM-based **P**rompt **O**ptimizer called **GPO**. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy.

### Prompt Optimization
After completing the parameter settings above, you can conduct prompt optimization by executing the following script.
```bash
python src/optimization/main.py
```
In our experiments, we use GPO.sh as the script for our prompt optimization framework.
```bash
bash GPO.sh
```

## 🌟 Results
The prompts optimized by our LLM-based prompt optimizer GPO are in the **GPO_results.jsonl**
